    <h2>The "Why?" Game</h2>
    <div class="content">
<h3>2014/7/31</h3>
 <p>There must have been a time in anyone's life where asking "why?" was an everyday occurence. Question recipients would, hopefully patiently, answer every question as best as they could&mdash;up to a point of course. For those particularly difficult or mundane (or repetitive) questions, we were likely told to consult an encyclopedia or the Internet or given a reply such as "you'll learn that when you grow up" or "stop asking questions!"</p> <p>Adults surprisingly do not ask "why?" nearly as often as they should. A lot of what is happening in the world is either accepted "as is," or glanced over due to lack of time or perhaps dismissed outright out of fear of becoming involved. To turn around stagnation in the workplace, companies encourage employees to "question the status quo," meaning to question why things are done the way they are done. (For what it's worth, "that's the way we've always done it" or "that's just the way it is" are not the right answers here.) Thinking about why you are doing what you do and how you could do it better is a powerful exercise in self-awareness, inside the office but also outside of it in your personal life.</p> <p>Especially when feeling overwhelmed or not knowing where to begin, the "why?" game is an easy tool to uncover where knowledge is lacking or where different points of view are needed. Here's an example:</p> <ul> <li>Why are animals put to sleep at shelters?</li> <li>Because noone claims them.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there are more animals than people can take care of.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because not all animals get neutered so they keep reproducing.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't realize it's a necessity to reduce the population and avoid some of these deaths.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there's no required exam for animal</li> ownership.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people haven't thought of it.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't see this as a problem.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't see animals as equals to humans.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there's no law that makes it so.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because nobody ever wrote a law.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because noone has wanted to put in the effort.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because it would have far-reaching consequences.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people like to eat animals and that would then need to change.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because if animals were equal to humans, we couldn't eat aminals anymore.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because humans do not eat (the equivalent of) humans.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because we established that is not a good thing.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because members of the same species usually don't eat each other.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because that's how they're wired; we see that all around nature.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because somehow one species sees another species are inferior.</li> </ul> <p>There, that's probably the reason: fundamentally, humans feel superior and so&mdash;although many of us feel uncomfortable with euthanizing animals&mdash;it's (often silently) accepted. The next steps after this realization is to question your beliefs. We already know animals have consiousness too. We know certain animals can see and hear more than humans ever could. Are they really inferior just because we could conquer them if we wanted to?</p> <p>Of course we see the same thing within the human species: "weaker" humans are often controlled by "stronger" humans. Perhaps we're just not good at recognizing "power" and have skewed its definition toward socio-economic or political status. Thinking about why that is is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

    <h2>A Greater Responsibility</h2>
    <div class="content">
<h3>2013/11/10</h3>
 <p>It's been a crazy few years. We've witnessed the bankruptcy of big, global, believed-to-be-stable corporations. We've witnessed grave invasions of privacy of ordinary people. We've witnessed manufacturers and food processors cut so many corners that now both animals <em>and</em> humans are being treated unethically. We've witnessed the collapse of entire governments, leaving citizens vulnerable to violence and lifelihoods and futures truly in jeopardy.</p> <p>These types of extraordinary events happening in such a short timeframe is probably enough to make most people fearful of what may be yet to come.</p> <p>We trusted our elected officials to do the right thing and serve the common long-term good rather than their short-term self-interest. We trusted the government to set the right policies and distribute wealth and equality. We trusted that there would be somebody to take care of us if we needed help. We thought our lives were stable; they were not. We're disappointed and we're discouraged.</p> <p>There no doubt these feelings are real and you are allowed to feel them, but let's face it: there is a lesson here for all of us to learn.</p>  <p>Did we truly believe the world machine would do what we think it should do and behave how we think it's right to behave, all without our direct involvement and, quite frankly, without the slightest bit of our care?</p> <p>Were we <em>that</em> foolish to think that by taking a backseat in our world life that the world would somehow turn out the way we expected it to? If you can read this then you will already have the life experience needed to know that taking on a passenger role hardly ever produces a satisfactory outcome.</p>  <p>So let's take some responsibility for what has occured and let's re-examine our involvement in the things that matter to us (in the things that--because of what has occured--we only now realize that they matter to us).</p> <p>Do not take this involvement lightly. Having to face the facts is going to be tough. You will have to be honest with yourself. You will need to look at the world objectively, removing your own stake in or gain from a specific outcome. You'll have to do research--often lots of it and often about trivial things. You will need to learn the specifics of how things work or operate. You may need to open doors that are purposely kept closed to you. You will need to think about how things can be done differently. You will have to play out scenarios of how things might go to see how your newly shaped beliefs hold up under various circumstances. You will constantly need to sharpen your beliefs as you find out new facts, and you will need the ability to abandon certain parts or all of your beliefs if they don't hold up to what you find out to be the truth--your truth. You must be strong enough to stick to your truth once you have gathered sufficient proof of it and have honestly considered alternatives with an open mind.</p> <p>This journey is certainly daunting but not unovercomeable. It wil be hard at first when you realize how much there is that you don't know. It will be hard to live an alternative lifestyle or believe in things that are not popular with the masses (or the mass media).</p> <p>As you go through this journey, always remind yourself that you're learning because you lack knowledge. You no longer want to take things for granted and make decisions based on assumptions or hearsay. To make informed desicions, you have to be informed. Always remind yourself that ignorance is not bliss, that you are putting in this effort so you can live an authentic and <em>real</em> life. Know that all of your hard work will lead to transparency, accountability and better relationships. Not just in your daily life, but also in your worldly life.</p> <p>Here are some examples to illustrate that things are not always as obvious as they seem:</p> <ul> <li>Meat: you made sure the meat came from a sustainable farm. But where was the animal slaughtered? If not at the farm, it could have been sent to the same slaughterhouse where any other animal is processed, meaning it could have been put to death the exact same way as a non-sustainably raised animal with the same utensils and tools that just seconds ago processed a non-sustainable raised animal.</li> <li>Everyday products: you made sure the products you buy are made in the country you live in. But do you know where the raw materials used to make the product came from? Ask the company who makes the products. If they don't know ask them to find out or who you can talk to to find out. Then ask that this information is listed publicly. If the materials are imported, can you trust the country of origin has the right policies in place for public safety and good worker conditions? Think about how you would go about measuring this. Then find out how this is actually measured by the raw material producer(s), by the country the materials are imported to and by the company who bought and uses the raw materials. If you get the runaround, stop doing business with them. And while you're at it, call the parent company, if applicable, and see if you get the same answers. <li>Food labeling: be aware that there are many alternative names for ingredients and that manufacturers may unknowingly or purposefully hide an unpopular or harmful ingredient under a different name. Find out who designed the food labels, in what order ingredients must be listed and what alternatives there are to food labels (e.g. mobile apps or Internet websites). <li>Organic food: find out what criteria food has to adhere to to receive the organic sticker. Do you agree with the criteria? Are there any common sense criteria missing? Is there money involved to get certified? Where does the money go? How do the various organic monitoring entities differ? Who runs them? While on the organic topic, also be aware that the wind may take pesticides sprayed on a neighboring crop to the organic farm. Look up the farm in your favorite online mapping application to check out the surrounding area, or better: visit the farm and form new relationships with the folks producing the food you consume. </ul> <p>The important thing is to not take someone else's word for it. Find things out for yourself. Demand that the people informing you (people you admire, the news media, politicians) provide resources and statistically relevant data. If they don't, make them aware that anyone should be able to verify claims made and/or absorb in greater detail the material behind those claims. If they refuse or can't or won't give you such references, don't just blindly believe what you hear. Find people and corporations that are transparent and support those instead. Practice what you preech and start providing references in your own communications (so learn to keep good notes). Feel free to start your own company. Feel free to start your own political party. You'll be surprised how much opportunity there is in the field of "do the right thing."</p>

    <h2>Keep asking "why?"</h2>
    <div class="content">
<h3>2013/06/15</h3>
 <p>Generally speaking, adults accept life for what it is.  Sustained by near-static routines that took years to establish, comfort and security are often seen as validation of effort put in. But such feelings stem from habit, not from choice. Decisions made without a component of critical reflection makes one vulnerable to outside influence and leads to mindlessness and disengagement.</p>  <p>For a personal daily routine this may be acceptable, but in relation to the planet, whose health and occupants must be kept in check, informing oneself about worldy affairs and expressing one's thoughts about it to others are minimum requirements of every person alive today.</p>  <p>Why do the majority of adults not ask "why?" when laws are passed that are dubious or have loopholes? (Why do they not even read the laws?) Why do the majority of adults shrug their shoulders when injustice is done but they themselves are not directly affected? (Why do they not take action?) Why do the majority of adults stay silent when people overseas are killed without a trial? (Why don't they see what kind of humanity this creates?) Why do the majority of adults keep buying the same products they always do, despite having just learned that the company that produced them evaded taxes or polluted the groundwater or mistreated their workers? (Why don't they do the work required to make a change?) Why do the majority of adults tell children to stop asking "why?" rather than exploring possibilities and diving into the details? (Why don't they make time to get to the bottom of things?) Why do the majority of adults become habitual creatures that gladly accept a false sense of comfort and a false sense of security rather than face the world for what it has become and vow to make it what they know it can be? (Why don't they seek the truth?)</p>  <p>The world needs role models. Critical thinkers who do their own research and come to their own conclusions. People who make sure their arguments are backed up by independently verifyable data. Folks who&mdash;if they feel strongly about something&mdash;don't compromise or accept some watered down version of their original idea.  If the people around them don't "approve," they seek out other people who are like-minded. They start their own companies or organizations. They start new kinds of societies. They will make mistakes, they might reinvent the wheel, but that's okay; that's called "learning by experience".</p>  <p>There are adults who do keep a critical finger on the pulse and participate actively in the processes that shape society. Do they not have a shortage of time like anybody else? Do they not have families to take care of? Do they not have aspirations of becoming successful in their jobs? Do they not care about getting a mark on their record? Of course they do, but it's relative; it's a trade-off. Sooner or later, everyone wakes up and realizes there's more to life than taking care of one's self and one's immediate surroundings. And after a wake-up call like that, it's hard to go back to life as it used to be. Compassion, tolerance, truth and justice are good keywords to live by. A good feeling to foster is: "if I don't do it, who will?"</p>  <p>"Why?" is the key that gets us to the heart of the matter. It reveals why an adult wasn't around when a child played with a gun (single parent, 2 jobs), why the child had access to the gun (negligence) or why there was a gun in the home at all (there's market for it) or why it was kept loaded (a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood).</p>  <p>We've heard it all before. There are a lot of reasons why certain things happen. But then again there are lots of reasons for why things are the way they are. The question then becomes: "are they the right reasons?"</p>

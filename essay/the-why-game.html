<h2>The "Why?" Game</h2>

<div class="date">Written on 2014/7/31 (<a href="https://github.com/criticalthinkers/ctp/commits/master/./essay/20141116-the-why-game">edit log available</a>)</div>

<div> <p>There must have been a time in anyone's life where asking "why?" was an everyday occurence. Question recipients would, hopefully patiently, answer every question as best as they could&mdash;up to a point of course. For those particularly difficult or mundane (or repetitive) questions, we were likely told to consult an encyclopedia or the Internet or given a reply such as "you'll learn that when you grow up" or "stop asking questions!"</p> <p>Adults surprisingly do not ask "why?" nearly as often as they should. A lot of what is happening in the world is either accepted "as is," or glanced over due to lack of time or perhaps dismissed outright out of fear of becoming involved. To turn around stagnation in the workplace, companies encourage employees to "question the status quo," meaning to question why things are done the way they are done. (For what it's worth, "that's the way we've always done it" or "that's just the way it is" are not the right answers here.) Thinking about why you are doing what you do and how you could do it better is a powerful exercise in self-awareness, inside the office but also outside of it in your personal life.</p> <p>Especially when feeling overwhelmed or not knowing where to begin, the "why?" game is an easy tool to uncover where knowledge is lacking or where different points of view are needed. Here's an example:</p> <ul> <li>Why are animals put to sleep at shelters?</li> <li>Because noone claims them.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there are more animals than people can take care of.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because not all animals get neutered so they keep reproducing.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't realize it's a necessity to reduce the population and avoid some of these deaths.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there's no required exam for animal</li> ownership.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people haven't thought of it.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't see this as a problem.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people don't see animals as equals to humans.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because there's no law that makes it so.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because nobody ever wrote a law.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because noone has wanted to put in the effort.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because it would have far-reaching consequences.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because people like to eat animals and that would then need to change.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because if animals were equal to humans, we couldn't eat aminals anymore.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because humans do not eat (the equivalent of) humans.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because we established that is not a good thing.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because members of the same species usually don't eat each other.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because that's how they're wired; we see that all around nature.</li> <li>Why?</li> <li>Because somehow one species sees another species are inferior.</li> </ul> <p>There, that's probably the reason: fundamentally, humans feel superior and so&mdash;although many of us feel uncomfortable with euthanizing animals&mdash;it's (often silently) accepted. The next steps after this realization is to question your beliefs. We already know animals have consiousness too. We know certain animals can see and hear more than humans ever could. Are they really inferior just because we could conquer them if we wanted to?</p> <p>Of course we see the same thing within the human species: "weaker" humans are often controlled by "stronger" humans. Perhaps we're just not good at recognizing "power" and have skewed its definition toward socio-economic or political status. Thinking about why that is is left as an exercise to the reader.</p> </div>

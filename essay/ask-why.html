<h2>Keep asking "why?"</h2>

<div class="date">Written on 2013/06/15 (<a href="https://github.com/criticalthinkers/ctp/commits/master/./essay/20130615-ask-why">edit log available</a>)</div>

<div> <p>Generally speaking, adults accept life for what it is.  Sustained by near-static routines that took years to establish, comfort and security are often seen as validation of effort put in. But such feelings stem from habit, not from choice. Decisions made without a component of critical reflection makes one vulnerable to outside influence and leads to mindlessness and disengagement.</p>  <p>For a personal daily routine this may be acceptable, but in relation to the planet, whose health and occupants must be kept in check, informing oneself about worldy affairs and expressing one's thoughts about it to others are minimum requirements of every person alive today.</p>  <p>Why do the majority of adults not ask "why?" when laws are passed that are dubious or have loopholes? (Why do they not even read the laws?) Why do the majority of adults shrug their shoulders when injustice is done but they themselves are not directly affected? (Why do they not take action?) Why do the majority of adults stay silent when people overseas are killed without a trial? (Why don't they see what kind of humanity this creates?) Why do the majority of adults keep buying the same products they always do, despite having just learned that the company that produced them evaded taxes or polluted the groundwater or mistreated their workers? (Why don't they do the work required to make a change?) Why do the majority of adults tell children to stop asking "why?" rather than exploring possibilities and diving into the details? (Why don't they make time to get to the bottom of things?) Why do the majority of adults become habitual creatures that gladly accept a false sense of comfort and a false sense of security rather than face the world for what it has become and vow to make it what they know it can be? (Why don't they seek the truth?)</p>  <p>The world needs role models. Critical thinkers who do their own research and come to their own conclusions. People who make sure their arguments are backed up by independently verifyable data. Folks who&mdash;if they feel strongly about something&mdash;don't compromise or accept some watered down version of their original idea.  If the people around them don't "approve," they seek out other people who are like-minded. They start their own companies or organizations. They start new kinds of societies. They will make mistakes, they might reinvent the wheel, but that's okay; that's called "learning by experience".</p>  <p>There are adults who do keep a critical finger on the pulse and participate actively in the processes that shape society. Do they not have a shortage of time like anybody else? Do they not have families to take care of? Do they not have aspirations of becoming successful in their jobs? Do they not care about getting a mark on their record? Of course they do, but it's relative; it's a trade-off. Sooner or later, everyone wakes up and realizes there's more to life than taking care of one's self and one's immediate surroundings. And after a wake-up call like that, it's hard to go back to life as it used to be. Compassion, tolerance, truth and justice are good keywords to live by. A good feeling to foster is: "if I don't do it, who will?"</p>  <p>"Why?" is the key that gets us to the heart of the matter. It reveals why an adult wasn't around when a child played with a gun (single parent, 2 jobs), why the child had access to the gun (negligence) or why there was a gun in the home at all (there's market for it) or why it was kept loaded (a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood).</p>  <p>We've heard it all before. There are a lot of reasons why certain things happen. But then again there are lots of reasons for why things are the way they are. The question then becomes: "are they the right reasons?"</p> </div>
